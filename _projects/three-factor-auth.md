## Project Overview
A comprehensive hardware-based security system implementing three layers of authentication: biometric fingerprint scanning, RFID tag verification, and secure keypad code entry.

## Key Features
- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint scanning for unique user identification
- **RFID Verification**: Contact-less card/tag authentication system
- **Keypad Security**: Secure PIN code entry as the third authentication factor
- **Fail-safe Design**: Multiple security layers with unauthorized access prevention

## Technical Highlights
- Arduino-based embedded system programming
- Integration of multiple hardware components (fingerprint sensor, RFID reader, keypad)
- Custom firmware development for authentication process management
- Security protocol implementation with layered verification system
