## Project Overview
An advanced computer vision system that analyzes basketball broadcasts using YOLOv8 object detection to track players, referees, basketball, and hoop in real-time.

## Key Features
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 implementation for detecting players, referees, hoop, and basketball
- **Real-time Tracking**: Advanced tracking algorithms for continuous object monitoring
- **Video Analytics**: Enhanced sports video analysis with bounding box visualization
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for real-time processing of HD broadcast footage

## Technical Highlights
- Custom YOLOv8 model training for basketball-specific objects
- Efficient tracking algorithms for fast-moving objects
- Real-time processing capabilities for live broadcast analysis
- Class segmentation and bounding box tracking implementation

## Implementation Details
The system uses a combination of:
1. **YOLOv8** for object detection
2. **OpenCV** for video processing
3. **PyTorch** for model inference
4. **Custom tracking algorithms** for object continuity

## Results
Successfully achieved real-time detection and tracking with high accuracy across various basketball broadcast scenarios.
